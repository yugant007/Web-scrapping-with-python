# scrapping-whether-website

This gives us the idea how we can extract the data from the differnt websites like --->
  * extracting the whether forcast data of a particular city.
  * extracting the match scores of football , cricket etc.
  * extracting the stock price of a particular stock.
  * extarcting the facebook data of your profile or any other person profile.

The main aim of this sort of extracting the data and manipulating the data is to minimize the time that we normally waste on simple daily 
life task.Thus we automate our some simple real life based tasked to minimize our precious time.

I have taken a simple example of web scrapping, i am collecting the data of weekly whether of the palce(city) and making a python script
to manipulate the data and hence when we run the script we will get the required details of the whether of the place we actually want.

I have used three python modules these are -->
  *requests --> This module is used because to get the html document of the whether website.
  *BeautifulSoup --> This module plays the main part as this module extracts the details that we want from the html document page.
  *pandas --> And finally this module is used to show the details of the extracted data in the clear format.
  
This is an example how we can make good use of BeautifulSoup module in python and make our life simpler.

So final conclusion about all this that get the live update of anything that we want without going again and again on the websites.
